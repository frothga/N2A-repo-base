 notes=Mix-in that sets reversal potential E based on the Nernst equation. Works closely with a concentration model.

  note=We pick some arbitrary bounds on the reversal voltage, rather than letting it go to infinity if outside or inside concentration goes to zero.
 @=IdealGas*temperature/(c.z*Faraday)*log(c.outside/c.inside)

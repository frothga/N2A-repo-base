  notes:|
   This temporary variable carries the same information as spike, but some models test the condition V>Vspike in multiple places. Using a temporary makes the model easier to read.
   
   This model use ">=" rather than ">" to compare the spike threshold, which makes the behavior slightly different from both NeuroML and some neuromorphic platforms. For neuroscience simulations, this detail is inconsequential. For neuromorphic computing, ">=" is easier to use because it gives an exact threshold without the need to add a "fudge factor" to synaptic weights.

 notes:A value (of any dimension) which follows the typical form for rate equations in the standard HH formalism. To use, include as a sub-part of Gate and reference x from some equation in Gate (usually one of α, β, τ or inf).

  notes:|
   The output value, with dimension determined by rate. Marked temporary so we can supply a value to Gate immediately during init. Strictly speaking, the temporary combiner should be ignored because this is a separate part. However, it will usually get flattened into Gate first.
   
   The NeuroML binding tau is for import. The bindings r and t are for export.

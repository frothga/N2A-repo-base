  notes:Delay between spike initiation and arrival, expressed as an integer number of cycles. Usually the spike takes effect before the B part is evaluated in the designated cycle. Negative numbers mean no-care, which allows the most efficient delivery scheme (boolean latching only). 0 means same-cycle delivery, which is impossible for most machines. The Internal and C backends will deliver a zero-delay event immediately after the current cycle completes, without any additional simulated time.

  notes:|
   Typically in [0,1], expressing a portion of the downstream neuron's voltage scale. You can generally assume the following about the downstream unit:
   * An exact match between applied voltage and threshold should produce a spike. Some neuromorphic models and platforms require that the threshold be exceeded rather than merely met, but backends should compensate for this.
   * It has some headroom for activation to exceed threshold.
   * It uses satuarting arithmetic rather than allowing an integer overflow.

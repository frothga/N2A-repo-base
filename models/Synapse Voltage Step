  notes:Delay between spike initiation and arrival, expressed as an integer number of cycles. Usually the spike takes effect before the B part is evaluated in the designated cycle. Negative numbers mean no-care, which allows the most efficient delivery scheme (boolean latching only). 0 means same-cycle delivery, which is impossible for most machines. The Internal and C backends will deliver a zero-delay event immediately after the current cycle completes, without any additional simulated time.

  notes:|
   Typically in [0,1], expressing a portion of the given voltage scale. You can generally assume the following about the downstream unit:
   * It's threshold must be a little lower than the applied voltage in order to guarantee subsequent firing. (Implementations of firing threshold are inconsistent across various simulators and devices.)
   * It has some headroom for activation to exceed threshold.
   * It uses satuarting arithmetic rather than allowing an integer overflow.

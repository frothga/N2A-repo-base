  notes:While not technically part of the model, this allows currents (in Amps) to be injected. Effectively, V and W become Volt values, even though they are not scaled in a way that is compatible with other parts. (The alternate approach, taken by NeuroML, is to create an extra set of parts that are dimensionless.)

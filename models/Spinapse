 notes:|
  Delivers a spike only if the source neuron selects our target index. Works together with Spineuron. To use in a syapse, $inherit from this as well as the parent Synapse (multiple inheritance). Should appear ahead of the parent Synapse. The source side (A) must be connected to a Spineuron.
  
  By default, this class supports connection to one population. To connect several downstream populations, manually assign each population a range and add an offset to B.$index in the event() function call.
  
  If B.$n is unknown or can vary, then you need to assemble the index offsets as variables in A. Assign each target population an ordinal position (0, 1, 2 ...). Call that position # in the following code. In each connection part, add these two lines:
  A.count#=B.$n
  A.offset#=A.offset{#-1}+A.count{#-1}
  Since A.offset0=0, you can omit that variable.
A.targetCount:+B.$n
in::event(A.spike && A.targetIndex==B.$index, delay, "nonzero")

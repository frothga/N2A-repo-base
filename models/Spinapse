 notes:|
  Delivers a spike only if the source neuron selects our target index. Works together with Spineuron. To use in a syapse, $inherit from this and then from a descendant of Synapse (multiple inheritance). The source side (A) must be connected to a Spineuron.
  
  By default, this class supports connection to one population. To connect several downstream populations, manually assign targetCount to be the sum of all the populations, then assign each population an offset to B.$index in the event() function call.
  
  If B.$n is unknown or can vary, then you need to assemble the index offsets as variables in A. Assign each target population an ordinal position (0, 1, 2 ...). Call that position # in the following code. In each connection part, add these two lines:
  A.count#=B.$n
  A.offset#=A.offset{#-1}+A.count{#-1}
  Since A.offset0=0, you can omit that variable.
A.targetCount:B.$n
in:event(A.spike && A.targetIndex==B.$index, delay, "nonzero")

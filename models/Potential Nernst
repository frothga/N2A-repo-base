 notes:Sets reversal potential E based on the Nernst equation. To use, place inside a Channel. Also connect "c" to the relevant Concentration model in the Compartment that contains the Channel.

  note:We pick some arbitrary bounds on the reversal voltage, rather than letting it go to infinity if outside or inside concentration goes to zero.

 notes=The Fitzhugh Nagumo model is a two-dimensional simplification of the Hodgkin-Huxley model of spike generation in squid giant axons.  This system was suggested by FitzHugh (FitzHugh R. [1961]: Impulses and physiological states in theoretical models of nerve membrane.  Biophysical J.  1:445-466), who called it " Bonhoeffer-van der Pol model ", and the equivalent circuit by Nagumo et al.  (Nagumo J., Arimoto S., and Yoshizawa S. [1962] An active pulse transmission line simulating nerve axon. Proc IRE. 50:2061-2070.1962). This version corresponds to the one described in FitzHugh R.[1969]: Mathematical models of excitation and propagation in nerve.  Chapter 1 (pp. 1-85 in H.P. Schwan, ed. Biological Engineering, McGraw-Hill Book Co., N.Y.)

  notes=While not technically part of the model, this allows currents (in Amps) to be injected. Effectively, V and W become Volt values, even though they are not scaled in a way that is compatible with other parts. (The alternate approach, taken by NeuroML, is to create an extra set of parts that are dimensionless.)

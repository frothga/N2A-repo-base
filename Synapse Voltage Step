 notes=This synapse directly changes the postsynaptic voltage by a specific increment. Primarily for use in models targeted to the STPU.
A=$connect("Neuron")
B=$connect("Neuron")
B.V=+Vstep@$event(A.V>=A.Vpeak,0)
Vstep=10mV

  notes=The desired change in postsynaptic voltage. This does not account for dynamics of the postsynaptic neuron, such as leakage current and voltage resets due to spiking.

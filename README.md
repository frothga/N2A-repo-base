# N2A base models

When N2A is first installed on a system, it creates a basic set of models to help the user get started. This set of models follows the NeuroML schema, and supports import/export in that format. The NeuroML schema is designed for realistic modeling of neurons at a level of detail generally accepted in the neuroscience community.

Note that N2A's function as a dynamical-system modeling tool is independent of neuroscience. It could have a different base model set for an entirely different domain.

    The output value, with dimension determined by rate. Marked temporary so we can supply a value to Gate immediately during init. Strictly speaking, the temporary combiner should be ignored because this is a separate part. However, it will usually get flattened into Gate first.
    
    The NeuroML binding tau is for import. The bindings r and t are for export.
